# JEST (Text editor)

## Description

The program is an online text editor where users may dependably store notes or code snippets and access them later, whether or not they have an internet connection. Because of the integrated service worker and cache APIs, the application will continue to operate normally even when there is no active internet connection. Even when the program is offline, the user of this application may view previously accessed sites.
